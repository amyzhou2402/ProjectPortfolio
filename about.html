                    Welcome! My name is Amy and thank you for taking the time to
                    check out my website.

                    Little about me - I have a background in Information Systems
                    but right before I graduated decided it wasn't the path for
                    me. I had enjoyed the tecnical aspects of my degree so much
                    but was disappointed when I had next to no experience at the
                    end of the 3 years.

                <h3>Nology:</h3>
                <br />
                <p class="text--centre">
                    _Nology gave me the opportunity to sit their tech training
                    course which takes exceptional people from a wide range of
                    backgrounds, with no tech experience, and teaches them how
                    to code in just 12 weeks.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p class="text--centre">
                    At the end of just 2 weeks, I've already learnt so much.
                    This was my first introduction to HTML and CSS/SCSS but here
                    I am, designing my own portfolio from scratch. I'm excited
                    to see where this will lead me and learn even more to add to
                    my portfolio collection here, so please keep an eye out for
                    these spaces
